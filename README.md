### Introduction:
AcTeamX by mechabotix is a team of high school students from Aitchison College Lahore Pakistan. We have been working on our robot since june .
We have won the National round and then qualified for international round. We are working hard to get the position in the International round as well.
Instead of buying OFF THE SHELF materials for the design of our car , we have designed our car by ourselves . We made 3d models then got the print of the car .
In the National round , we made a design and used that oe but that was really big car and we afraid that it may hit the obstacles so we changed the design making it smaller one .
As far as the electrical components are concerned , we have used pixy camera for detecting the obstacles and used sonar sensors for avoiding the walls .
