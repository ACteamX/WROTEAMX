# WroTeamX


This repository contains technical materials for a self-navigating vehicle prototype intended for the WRO Future Engineers event in the 2023 season. Detailed insights into each subcomponent of the robotic system can be explored in the README.md files located within respective folders.

### Contents:

- **Build:** Detailed documentation focusing on our chassis design and the rationale behind the chosen materials.
- **Electrical:** Schematic diagrams illustrating the interconnections among various electromechanical components, including datasheets and explanations for component selection.
- **Models:** Files used by 3D printers to fabricate the vehicle's components.
- **t-Photos:** Folder containing team photos.
- **v-Photos:** Images of the robot.
- **Src:** Software code responsible for controlling all the components programmed for the competition.
- **Schemes:** Documentation and diagrams elucidating our approach to solving the competition's challenges.
- **Video:** Includes the 'video.md' file containing the link to a video demonstrating the vehicle's operational abilities.

### Introduction:

AcTeamX by mechabotix is a team of high school students from Aitchison College Lahore Pakistan. We have been working on our robot since june .
We have won the National round and then qualified for international round. We are working hard to get the position in the International round as well.
Instead of buying OFF THE SHELF materials for the design of our car , we have designed our car by ourselves . We made 3d models then got the print of the car .
In the National round , we made a design and used that oe but that was really big car and we afraid that it may hit the obstacles so we changed the design making it smaller one .
As far as the electrical components are concerned , we have used pixy camera for detecting the obstacles and used sonar sensors for avoiding the walls .
